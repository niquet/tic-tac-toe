# tic-tac-toe
A Game-Interface for a JavaScript Workshop that I conducted

## How to play
1. **Choose which player goes first** by clicking on the switch icon you can find left to the game board. The player that has to set his figure on the board is marked by a dark background in the icon.

2. Now **each player can set their figure** on the board, each taking turns doing so.

3. If their is a **winner**, the icon background in the switch changes its background-color to green.

## Example gameplay

Here you can see the interface. Player "x" chose to start in this round of the game.
