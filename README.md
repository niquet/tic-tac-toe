# tic-tac-toe
A Game-Interface for a JavaScript Workshop that I conducted

## How to play
1. **Choose which player goes first** by clicking on the switch icon you can find left to the game board. The player that has to set his figure on the board is marked by a dark background in the icon.

2. Now **each player can set their figure** on the board, each taking turns doing so.

3. If their is a **winner**, the icon background in the switch changes its background-color to green.

## Example gameplay

Here you can see the interface. Player "x" chose to start in this round of the game.

Player "x" set the figure, now the active player switched. Player "o" is taking turns.

Player "x" is one move away from winning this round.

Player "x" is won this round. You can see that the switches' background-color changed to green. To start the next round, press the restart button in the menu right to the board.
